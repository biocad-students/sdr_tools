# python code description

This folder contains PyMOL plugin code from my MSc, refactored and improved.

As a start point I took plugin's code from MSc repo.
TODOs:
- change pockets search mechanism - from triangle-based to tetrahedra-based.
- change start region selection
- take different tools for energy hotspot prediction and compare their properties with and without filtering (add several scripts in separate subfolders)
