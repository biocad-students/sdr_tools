# sdr_tools
code for finding specificity determining regions (with draft code in Scala)

I planned to use this repo for my thesis scripts, and decided to open MS_thesis instead, and to use this repo for saving files & code in Scala I promised to write.
I'll put final code version after refactoring to zmactep/ig-toolkit, this repo will contain some additional benchmarks and test scripts.
